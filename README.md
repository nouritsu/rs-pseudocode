This project has been abandoned. A pseudocode interpreter is not viable, nor is it practical.

An interpreter for a statically typed language is not a good idea and is not an enjoyable experience to implement.
An interpreter for pseudocode - a "language" that is supposed to be used to clarify logic or start designing an application should not have strict grammar checking or a mode of execution.
